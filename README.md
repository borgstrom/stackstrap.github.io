There is an incredible wealth of open-source DevOps tools available today, all
with their own growing communities. With the advent of Node.js, a wave of
people are working with the Linux command line for the first time. Patterns
that were long only the territory of pure hackers are being optioned by the
folks who have been pushing the boundaries of media. There is an incredible
opportunity to normalize and grow the patterns we use to build new things.
The problem is that into order to utilize all of this goodness you need an
awful lot of background knowledge to get to the point where it works
effectively.

StackStrap is decentralized in nature and could be described as a [PaaS] that
companies can run for themselves. The project aims to simplify the process of
building and deploying web based applications and services using existing
open-source. By building up around existing projects StackStrap becomes little
more than an evolving strategy. The project is geared towards smaller operations
which employ a wide range of skill levels and may not be able to afford in house
developer operations. The idea is to offer the simplicities of services like
[Heroku] while allowing companies to leverage the costs savings of root cloud
services like [AWS].

Ultimately StackStrap is a strategy for utilizing the three greatest
automation innovations that have ever been offered to the web development
community. StackStrap revolves around the idea that the core of a well oiled
project is little more than a tree of files. Some of those files should be able
to describe how to automate things into a state that just works. Teams should be
enabled to learn a short list of simple commands which enable clear objectives.
This will allow teams to easily apply more structure to their workflows so they
can spend more time making the things they love while worrying less.
