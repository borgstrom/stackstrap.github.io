In a sense StackStrap is a decentralized [PaaS] which aims to simplify the
process of building and deploying web based applications and services. The
project is geared towards smaller operations which employ a wide range of skill
levels and may not be able to afford in house developer operations. The idea is
to build upon the simplicities offered by services like [Heroku] while allowing
companies to leverage the costs savings of bare bones cloud services like [AWS]
or [Digital Ocean]. Ultimately StackStrap is a strategy for utilizing the three
greatest tools that have ever been offered to the web development community. The
core focus is ensuring that workflows are easy to understand and manipulate.
This will allow teams to apply more structure to their workflows and spend more
time making the things they love while worrying less about operations.

There is an incredible wealth of open-source DevOps tools available today, all
with their own growing communities. With the advent of Node.js a wave of
people are working with the Linux command line for the first time. Patterns
that were long only the territory of pure hackers are being optioned by the
folks who have been pushing the boundaries of media. There is an incredible
opportunity to normalize and grow the patterns we use to build new things.

StackStrap revolves around the idea that the core of a well oiled project is
little more than a tree of files. Each time we set out to build something new
we learn something about how to do it better next time. The patterns which we
grow to enable our project workflows should be distilled and kept in version
control. We may build certain things in certain ways, but each new project is
always drawn from a bag of tricks.  StackStrap aims to ensure that the bag of
tricks works better for everyone.
