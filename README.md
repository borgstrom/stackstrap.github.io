There is an incredible wealth of open-source DevOps tools available today, all
with their own growing communities. With the advent of Node.js a wave of
people are working with the Linux command line for the first time. Patterns
that were long only the territory of pure hackers are being optioned by the
folks who have been pushing the boundaries of media. There is an incredible
opportunity to normalize and grow the patterns we use to build new things.

StackStrap revolves around the idea that the core of a well oiled project is
little more than a tree of files. Each time we set out to build something new
we learn something about how to do it better next time. The patterns which we
grow to enable our project workflows should be distilled and kept in version
control. We may build certain things in certain ways, but each new project is
always drawn from a bag of tricks.  StackStrap aims to ensure that the bag of
tricks works better for everyone.
